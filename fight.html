          <h1> The Notorious <i><b> Conor McGregor<i><b></h1>
      <p><h2> intro </h2>
      <p><h3> Conor McGregor is debatably the baddest in the sport. He is often regarded as bringing the UFC to the point in popularity that it is 
      now. He is regarded as a "salesman", as he sells the fight, he makes people want to watch him fight, and probably get knocked out too. 
      He started boxing at a young age, and rose to popularity fairly quickly. He went on to become known world wide as an MMA phenom. 
      Many, (formerly including myself) consider him to be cocky and arrogant, too much for his own good. Many dislike him for his attitude and 
      disrespectful nature, but at the end of the day you realize that he needs people to watch his fight for him to get paid. He truly is the 
      best known in the sport. When you say MMA, most people say Conor McGregor. Here, you will learn about, and maybe even appreciate Conor Mcgregor.

      <p><h2> Early Days </h2>
      
      <p><h3> Based out of Dublin, Ireland, McGregor started boxing at a young age, and later moved into mixed martial arts, Along with his best
      friend Tom Egan. He decided to give his life to MMA, which would also mean that he would not make much. He was poor for a time, chasing the 
      dream of being best in the world. He would continue to fight in ametour fights, while Egan would make it to the UFC, to become the first Irishman
      to make it to the big leagues of MMA. McGregor soon realized that was what he wanted. He continued to train hard, after taking a break. He would
      soon make it into the UFC under the training of an Icelandic fighter named Gunnar Nelson. He would quickly rise to become the fighter we all 
            recognize and most -whether they like him or not- respect. </h3>

      <p><h2> Currently/Near Past </h2>
            
      <p><h3> Conor McGregor is known as the wealthiest MMA fighter in the world, with a net worth of 200 million dollars! He made this money through his 
            extensive, and impressive MMA career. He first started with an impressive win against Marcus Brimage, and then went on to fight an impressive 
            fighter on his own, Max Holloway, as his second fight, which he won by unanimus decision. He then went on a long streak of wins, where he became
            a double champion (a champion in two different weight classes), the first that we had ever seen in the UFC. The fight streak ended with Nate Diaz,
            via submission. He then went on to win against Nate Diaz, as his next fight, fighting him twice in a row. He won this second match proving his 
            resilience and strength. But no one could have predicted what would happened in the debatably most famous of his fights. The Khabib Fight. </h3>

            <p><h2> The Storm </h2>
            
            <p><h3> Many refer to the Khabib and McGregor fight as the storm, because many consider it to be Conor McGregors undoing. It is also one of the 
            biggest fights in MMA history. It was a intense fight, and one with the stakes risen high. Conor McGregor had been his usual self, and sold the fight,
            making Khabib out to be his rival. He hyped up the fight to the point that 2.4 million people bought the PPV (pay-per-view). It was an intense and
            incredible fight, ending in an all out riot when Khabib submitted McGregor. Khabib clipped Conor with a right hand, setting him down, where khabib would
            go down and finish him. It will go down as one of the greatest and most anticipated fights in all of UFC history, and is a crazy fight to go back 
            and re-watch. </h3>

            <p><h2> Current </h2>
            
            <p><h3> Currently, Conor is taking part in the ultimate fighter, a series out of the UFC, where a proffessional trains ametour fighters in hopes
            of getting them into the UFC. He plans to fight Michael Chandler, but the weight, time, and event are unsure. Many fans are waiting eagerly for he return
            of Conor McGregor, as it has been 3 years since he last fought. I personally cannot wait for his "notorious" return. </h3>
