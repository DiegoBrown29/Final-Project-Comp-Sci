          <h1> The Notorious <i><b> Conor McGregor<i><b></h1>
      <p><h2> intro </h2>
      <p><h3> Conor McGregor is debatably the baddest in the sport. He is often regarded as bringing the UFC to the point in popularity that it is 
      now. He is regarded as a "salesman", as he sells the fight, he makes people want to watch him fight, and probably get knocked out too. 
      He started boxing at a young age, and rose to popularity fairly quickly. He went on to become known world wide as an MMA phenom. 
      Many, (formerly including myself) consider him to be cocky and arrogant, too much for his own good. Many dislike him for his attitude and 
      disrespectful nature, but at the end of the day you realize that he needs people to watch his fight for him to get paid. He truly is the 
      best known in the sport. When you say MMA, most people say Conor McGregor. Here, you will learn about, and maybe even appreciate Conor Mcgregor.

      <p><h2> Early Days </h2>
      
      <p><h3> Based out of Dublin, Ireland, McGregor started boxing at a young age, and later moved into mixed martial arts, Along with his best
      friend Tom Egan. He decided to give his life to MMA, which would also mean that he would not make much. He was poor for a time, chasing the 
      dream of being best in the world. He would continue to fight in ametour fights, while Egan would make it to the UFC, to become the first Irishman
      to make it to the big leagues of MMA. McGregor soon realized that was what he wanted. He continued to train hard, after taking a break. He would
      soon make it into the UFC under the training of an Icelandic fighter named Gunnar Nelson. He would quickly rise to become the fighter we all 
      recognize and most -whether they like him or not- respect.
