            <p><h4>Mixed martial arts (or MMA)is not for the queasy, nor the easily disturbed. 
            While it is a violent and at times gory sport, it can also be graceful.
            "How can such a violent sport be graceful?" you may ask. Allow me to explain.
            Mixed Martial Arts is made up primarily of -but is not limited to- five major martial arts: 
            Wrestling, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, boxing and kickboxing. 
            Again, though these are the most popular, there are many different styles that you can use in a MMA bout. 
            It has been seen that martial arts such as Kung Fu, Karate and (now making it's way into the mainstream) Judo have been seen, 
            though typically many MMA fighters stick to the basic five. No sport is easy, all take a level of technique and are physically demanding,
            and MMA is no exception. Many (including me) consider MMA to be the most physically and mentally demanding sport on the planet. 
            MMA takes extreme discipline, and no doubt takes a physical toll, requiring a fighter to not only deliver, but take heavy strikes to he head and body. 
            In order for you to get a better grasp on MMA, I will go over the rules of the sport, the weight classes and some of the most promising prospects in the sport. 
            Allow me to take you throught the brilliant and complex
            sport of Mixed Martial Arts.</p></h4>
            
            <p><h2><b> Rules </b></p></h2>
            
            <p><h4>There are little, but important rules in the sport of MMA. In such a violent sport, following the rules can prevent very serious injuries.
            For example, there is a rule against hitting your opponent in the back or especially in the back of the head. 
            Think what would happen if someone took a brutal strike to the spine, the results could be catastrophic for the victim. 
            Other rules meant to protect the fighters are rules such as these: no eye gouging or fish hooking (placing your finger in the opponents mouth) of any kind,-or really any other gouging that you an think of-, 
            no kicks or knee strikes to an opponent that is grounded, no throwing an opponent to the ground by their head or neck, 
            no head butting, no hair pulling and no groin strikes. Lastly the most important rule of them all: follow the referee's instruction at all time.
            Failure to follow the referee's instruction can and almost always will end in disqualification. 
            Amongst these rules, there are more small technicalities that you must follow. But those are some of the most basic rules;
            even in a fighting sport -which many consider to be barbaric already- there is still a system, after all, we are not animals. </h4>
            
            <p><h2><b> Weight Classes </b></h2></p>
            
            <p><h4>MMA is split into weight classes to ensure that the fight is fair. We wouldn't want to see a giant 260 pound man crush a mere 150 pound figher.
            Weight classes depend on the league of mma that you are watching. Here is a table to help you understand the UFC (ultimate fighting championsip; one of the most popular leagues)</h4>

<p><h2><b> MMA Leagues </h2></b>
<p><h4>there are several different leagues in MMA that you can go pro in. Though some are bigger than others. There are several minor leagues that everyone
  should start in to get to the top, such as Tuff' N' Uff, and Titan FC and Cage Warriors. But there are bigger ones that are more popularly followed, 
  such as Rizin, ONE, and Bellator MMA. But the biggest goal for an MMA fighter is the UFC -or Ultimate Fighting Championship-. When you think of football,
  you think of the NFL. When you think of hockey, you think of the NHL. Likewise, when many think of MMA, they associate it with the UFC. Sometimes to the 
  point of accidentally calling the sport UFC. The UFC holds names to some of the greatest fighters in the sport such as Khabib Nurmagomedov, George St-pierre,
  and Jon Jones. Once you get the belt in the UFC, you etch your name amongst the greatest of the sport. You have worked your way to the top and winning the gold belt is
  a sign that you've made it. It is also home to some of the greatest MMA fights ever. My personal favorite is the Diaz and Edwards fight, though (my fav 
  figher) Nate Diaz lost, he put up a brutal fight against Leon Edwards and showed his grit and perseverance. It was an overall amazing fight.
  <b>here</b> is the link to the UFC website if you would like to know some of the upcoming fights and information on
  anything else related to the UFC. Because the UFC is the biggest (and quite frankly my favorite) MMA entertainment source, I will focus on that. </h4>

            <p><h3>Alexander Volkanovski</h3>
            
            <p><h4>Alexander Volkanovski is a champion in the middleweight weight class and has one of the most impressive records in the UFC. at 25-2, alexander
            had an incredible fight streak until the questionable decision in which Islam Makhachev won the fight after 5 brutal rounds. </h4>
  


<a href= "khamzat2.jpg"><img src= "khamzat2.jpg" width = "75%" height = "75%"></a>

<p><h3>Khamzat Chimaev</h3>
  
<p><h4>Khamzat Chimaev is one of the best fighters of the generation, and one of the most promising prospects. Though he missed the fight of
  his career with Nate Diaz (my personal favorite fighter) because he missed weight, he still remains a brilliant and strategic fighter. He is a 
  3 time wrestling national champion in Sweden, and is very entertaining to watch. He quickly rose to the top most dangerous fighters in he division. </h4>
  
  <p><a href= "Yair.jpg"><img src = "Yair.jpg" width = "75%" height = "75%"></a>
    
  <p><h3> Yair Rodriguez </h3>
  <p><h4> Yair Rodriguez is a very promising upcoming fighter. He is skilled with his shots, landing them with precision, intention and power. 
  His speciality is kicks, ending fights because of the power of these strikes. He has deafeated big names like Brian Ortega, BJ Penn and Dan Hooker. 
  He is no doubt a disciplined and talented fighter.</h4>
  
  
  <p><a href = "Shavkat.jpeg"><img src = "Shavkat.jpeg" width = "75%" height = "75%"></a>
    
    <p><h3> Shavkat Rakhmonov </h3>
    
    <p><h4>Shavkat Rakhmonov is a fighter that many consider could be one of the greatest of all time. He has an impressive fight streak and 
    all of his fights are made for the highlight reels. He is a talented striker and grappler, and knows fighting strategy better than 
    many in the division. I'm very excited to see where he goes in the UFC.</h4>
    

    <h4> If you would like a place to start in MMA, here are some of my favorite fighters to watch. If your curious,
    I think these fighters are a good place to start watching. You can find the link
  <a href="UFC.html"><src= "UFC.html"> here. </a> Now, your probably wondering about Conor Mcgregor,
    the biggest and baddest in the sport. Why haven't I mentioned him yet? Well, that is because I believe he 
    deserves his own section. If you would like to learn more about the "Notorious" Conor Mcgregor, you can find his

    <p><h2> Conclusion</h2>
    <h4><p> I hope you can now see some of the appeal to the sport of mixed martial arts. Many consider the sport to be needlessly violent,
    but I believe that there is not only strategy in the sport, but some grace and class as well. I wish that your interest in the sport has been peaked, 
    and that possibly in the future you can enjoy the sport as well - either watching, or even participating in any aspect of the sport-. (and just 
      for a little fun, here is one of my favorite highlights in MMA.
